# MoviesApp
Final project for Developing Android Apps @ Udacity

Done with part 2

Since my api key was free, i was not able to test and create trailer's and review's database because i could not fetch the information in the internet.

There is a bug when you first install the app you need to go to settings and change movies sort order so that you may see the movies. It's fixable but i have no time right now since i moved to Advanced Android Apps course @ Udacity too.

Things to improve:
- Mostly layouts need more work;
- Add transitions between activity's
- Improve Ui for the users depending on which device they are using;
